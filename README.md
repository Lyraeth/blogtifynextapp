## Perpose

This project is an implementation of the Fullstack web Next.js Tutorial [How to Build a Fullstack App with Next.js, Prisma, and Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres) atau [blogr-nextjs-prisma](https://github.com/prisma/blogr-nextjs-prisma), which previously used Next.js version 13.5.4 with the Pages Router, and which I have rebuilt using Next.js version 14.2.5 with the App Router. The purpose of this is for my learning of Next.js.

In the implementation of this website, I was assisted by the tutorial:

- [Next-Auth in App Router of Next.js](https://medium.com/@rohitkumarkhatri/next-auth-in-app-router-of-next-js-7df037f7a2ad) - learn about how to implement NextAuth.js on Next.js 14 with App Router.

and this project has been deployed on Vercel, you can check it on this link -> [Blogtify](blogtifynextapp.vercel.app)

## Getting Started
